# Explaining Low Dimensional Representations

```Plumb, Gregory, et al. "Explaining Groups of Points in Low-Dimensional Representations." International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2020.

This repository contains the implementation of the above paper. The original paper proposes a Transitive Global Translations Algorithm to explain the differences between the *group of points* in the low-dimensional space. In this repository, the claims and the results of the paper are studied and validated. Furthermore, we extend the TGT with a scaling function. 
We organize the readme as follows:
